            <i class="fas fa-heart-broken"></i> I really messed up, and I'm so sorry for that. I never meant to make you feel uncomfortable or disrespected. What happened has made it hard for me to even think about talking and making eye contact anymore 🥺.You deserve someone better than me.

You may have talked to other boys, but I was probably the most annoying 😞. You were the first girl I met and I really cared about, and I messed up badly.

I'll respect your space and won't bother you anymore. Take care of yourself and all the best for your future, my queen 🫶🫶. I'll always cherish the good times we had.

Goodbye, and once again, I'm truly sorry.
SID ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹"
